## 2.0.0

### Info
**This update is absolutely not save game compatible.**
 > I'm going to attempt to list every little thing for the changelog nerds, but there are possibly many things I missed in my sleep deprived haze. Performance might be a little heavier this update.

 - Updated every single out-of-date mod within the list (there was a lot I know)
 - Lots of meshes now have parallax enabled (Whiterun, Boats, Riften, Raven Rock, etc.)
 - Included a performance DynDOLOD Output for mashed potato PCs that might need it (check readme!)
 - Fixed the `Patrician - Normal` ENB Preset being structured improperly
 - Azura's Statue should finally stop disappearing now
 - Bloody vampire clutter should be fixed and not weirdly glowing anymore
 - Cleaned up some clipping that occurred with NotWL
 - Desaturated some grass and plants since some are horrifically vibrant
 - Edited QW's Grass Patch so that Folkvangr Rift Grass is used instead
 - Also removed Fall Forest Shrubs because I dislike all retextures for them
 - Fixed an issue with weapon trails that can occur with mods like VAE
 - Fixed dark-face bugs on some CC NPCs
 - Fixed dark glacier and snow lods; should be the proper brightness now
 - Fixed oversized chaurus egg models in inventories (thank you, Jyuu!)

 - Reduced the glow from ElSopa's potions
 - Reinstalled Real Dwemer Pipes to integrate Improved Dwemer Glass + JS' Dwemer stuff correctly
 - Removed hanging moss within the Blue Palace (Todd why)
 - Removed the Quick Start player sword that is given, provided an enchanted leveled weapon in the starting chest instead
 - Reordered many assets and separators
 - Replaced BnP tintmasks with Bijin's tintmasks
 - Switched to Reverie's skin diffuses with a custom skin blend between BnP and Reverie for vampires
 - Resolved some jank-looking fluffwork meshes and added patches for new animals (Vale Deer, Trolls, Cows, Elks, Foxes, Huskies)
 - Resolved z-fighting meshes in Windhelm (fuck windhelm)
 - Snow mountain trims should now use Polar Peaks textures
 - Stopped the CC Colossus Skeleton from T-posing (thank you, Jyuu!)
 - Stripped the Waterplants plugin so only Dave's lilypad models are used
 - Thistles, Nightshades, and Sword Ferns should have the up-to-date 3D Cathderal meshes now
 - Turned off Animated Stars within Rudy ENB to prevent awful flickering stars at night
 - Waterwheels should be using proper meshes now
 - Water LODs should also (mostly) be fixed on the Rudy ENB profile
 - Regenerated LODs and Synthesis Outputs

## 1.1.1

### Info

**This update is save game compatible.**
 - Tiny update to address the broken Blades Armor Retexture meta file

## 1.1.0
### Info

**This update is not save game compatible.**
 - Did some bugfixes and asset reordering, although I don't remember all changes, but bugs like chaurus eggs being wonky, Statue of Azura dissapearing, ice caves having green cave meshes, floating mushrooms on dead trees, and missing textures for Soul Cairn trees should be fixed now!
 - LODs should be a tiny bit better brightness wise, but they are still unfortunately 2D since Nature of the Wildlands doesn't have full/hybrid 3D LODs support
